# Minecraft Enhanced Texture Pack
High resolution texture pack with vanilla Minecraft style.

Goal of this texture pack is to provide HD textures not themed in any way, but to stick as close as possible to original vanilla Minecraft.

This project is based on the project [Minecraft Enhanced](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/resource-packs/1234744-32x-64x-96x-128x-256x-v1-7-9-minecraft-enhanced). The original project seems to be abandoned since mid of 2014, so this is an approach to continue the great work for recent Minecraft versions.
All the Copyright for the initial images is by [cferrill1](http://www.minecraftforum.net/members/cferrill1).

In contrast to the original project, there is no MCPatcher support planned. All files which are not necessary for pure vanilla Minecraft support are removed.

As not everybody likes all designs included in this project, the releases are split into groups like Blocks, Items, Mobs and similar to allow easy selection of the desired part. With this change it is also possible to have different resolutions for the groups.
